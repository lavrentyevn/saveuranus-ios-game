# Gameplay

Controls of the game are very simple: by tapping on the left or the right side of the screen your Spaceship jumps left or right respectively.

Once you are comfortable with controls, asteroids and spaceships start falling from space. There are two types of falling objects **at first**:

- **Asteroids** - evil spheres that want to destroy Uranus. You have to hit them as you jump **before** they touch the ground. If you succeed you get a point, otherwise you lose it.
- **Medical Spaceships** - good spaceships that heal the planet. You should not hit them. If you let them hit the ground you a get a point, otherwise you lose it.

Once you hit 30 point a new enemy appears.

- **Deathships** - evil spaceships that are **deadly** to your planet. You have to hit them as you jump **before** they touch the ground. If you succeed you get a point, otherwise **it's game over**.

There is also a **timer** at the top of the screen. If you hit an enemy ball, the timer resets. If time runs out it is game over.

The game has pleasant music, sound effects and vibration. But if you want to play the game with your own music, you can turn off game music in the pause menu.

Once you lose you get a game over screen where you can see your highscore, coins and survival time.

You can also **customize** your Spaceship. Your score when you end your run adds to your coins. Using these coins you can buy a new spaceship.
